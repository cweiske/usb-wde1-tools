usb-wde1 tools
--------------
Tools to collect and analyze data from the USB-WDE1 weather receiver from ELV.de


idea
----
1. pipe each received line to a command
2. command splits up line into variables
3. add variable data to rrdtool
4. repeat


idea: cat socat output to "read"



Test it:
$ php lines-to-stdout.php | ./work-with-lines.sh




RRDtool database setup
----------------------
EXAMPLE
        rrdtool create temperature.rrd --step 300 \
         DS:temp:GAUGE:600:-273:5000 \
         RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:1200 \
         RRA:MIN:0.5:12:2400 \
         RRA:MAX:0.5:12:2400 \
         RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:2400

 This sets up an RRD called temperature.rrd which accepts one temperature value every 300 seconds. If no new data is supplied for more than 600 seconds, the temperature becomes *UNKNOWN*.  The minimum acceptable value is -273 and the maximum is 5'000.

 A few archive areas are also defined. The first stores the temperatures supplied for 100 hours (1'200 * 300 seconds = 100 hours). The second RRA stores the minimum temperature recorded over every hour (12 * 300 seconds = 1 hour), for 100 days (2'400 hours). The third and the fourth RRA's do the same for the maximum and average temperature, respectively.
